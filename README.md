# EcoBin

## Abstract
The world faces a mounting crisis with the rapid increase in waste generation due to global development. Waste, often produced by both industries and households, poses significant risks to the environment and public health. Chemical materials used in various products further compound these issues. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka lacks a proper waste disposal system. In response, "Ecobin," an e-waste management app, has been developed to tackle these challenges.
Ecobin connects waste producers, collectors, and recyclers, offering a convenient and profitable waste disposal solution. By facilitating communication through a chat function, users can efficiently manage waste disposal. This initiative not only curbs waste pollution but also promotes recycling and enhances environmental safety.
In summary, Ecobin is a groundbreaking waste management app that addresses pressing environmental concerns. Through collaboration and effective waste disposal, it transforms waste into valuable resources while fostering a greener and more sustainable world.

 ## Introduction
 In an era marked by relentless technological advancement and global development, the issue of waste management has emerged as a critical concern. Waste, generated both by industrial processes and households, poses grave threats to the environment and public well-being. The hazardous nature of certain waste materials, particularly those containing chemicals, has exacerbated the challenges associated with waste disposal. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka currently lacks a comprehensive and efficient waste disposal system, and this deficiency has far-reaching implications.
The "Ecobin" project represents a conscientious response to these challenges, offering a transformative solution to the ever-growing waste problem. In this report, we embark on a journey through the development and implementation of Ecobin, an innovative e-waste management app. Ecobin serves as a bridge connecting waste producers, collectors, and recyclers, presenting an opportunity for responsible waste disposal and resource utilization.
This project is significant for several reasons. It not only addresses the pressing environmental concerns surrounding waste management but also contributes to the sustainable development goals of the nation. Moreover, Ecobin aligns with the global shift towards responsible consumption and production, emphasizing the need to recycle and reduce waste generation.
As we delve into the details of this project, we will explore its objectives, methodology, outcomes, and the wider context of the waste management landscape in Sri Lanka. Through the lens of Ecobin, we aim to provide insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with responsible waste management, ultimately paving the way for a greener and more sustainable future.
